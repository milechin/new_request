# New Request
## Description

As an HPC facilitator I assist researchers with troubleshooting their code or optimizing their code.  To keep my work organized I created this bash script that generates a directory structure to support my work for any new request I recieve.  

## Requirements

Git needs to be installed. For helper scripts generated, they use LMOD module load commands.

## Usage

```console
Syntax: new_request.sh CLIENT TICKET DIR
Arguments:
    CLIENT     A client identifier (e.g. username).
    TICKET     Request identifier (e.g. ticket number).
    DIR        Location to create directory hierarchy (if blank defaults to pwd).
```

The bash script will create a new request directory using the CLIENT and TICKET arguments as unique identifiers.  The directory will be initialized as a git repository.  For example, running the example command below will create a directory "bob/123456" in the current working directory:

```console
bash new_request.sh bob 123456
Initialized empty Git repository in /projectnb/dvm-rcs/client/bob/123456/.git/
```

The script will also generate a `.gitignore` file with the following contents:

Additionally, a helper bash scripts will be generated in the `env_setup` directory for creating R environments.  

 - `r_env.sh` - This bash scripts will load the specified module, create a directory to install packages, install packages that are required for VSCode, and generate append to the 'module_load.sh' script for setting up the environment (Load the appropriate module and set `R_LIBS_USER` environment variable.).

 Example Usage

 ```console
    source r_env.sh R/4.4.0
 ```


## Directory Structure

Below is the directory structure the bash script will create:

- *data* - Directory to store relevant data used by the client's scripts.
- *env_setup* - Directory to store scripts files associated with setting up the enviroment for the request at hand.
- *scripts* - Directory to store the client's scripts.
- *output* - Directory to store the output data generated by the client's scripts.
- *module_load.sh* - A script that can be updated with `module load` commands and any other environment settings.
